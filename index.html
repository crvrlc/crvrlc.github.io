		<h1 class="name">What's My Name?</h1>
		<p>Hi! I am Leila Camille L. Cervera.</p>

		<h1 class="nickname">What You Can Call Me</h1>
		<p>People usually call me Leila or Lei :)</p>

		<h1 class="cmsc">Favorite CMSC Subject</h1>
		<p>As of the moment, CMSC 130: Logic Design and Digital Computer Circuits has been my favorite. I really enjoyed studying that subject â€” analyzing the mind-bending problems and answering the challenging exercises. The topics and real-world problems in that subject are really interesting!</p>

		<h1 class="ge">Favorite GE </h1>
		<p>I haven't taken much GE yet, but I enjoyed attending my KAS 1 class. Studying the events that happened in the past (and even the present) in our country became so fascinating. I also enjoyed attending the events with incentives for they are informative too.</p>

		<h1 class="proglang">Favorite Programming Language</h1>
		<p>Because I have no solid programming background, Python has become my favorite language ever since I entered the university. Though it has been quite challenging for me, I guess it's the easiest to understand because it is close to the human language.</p>

		<h1 class="food">Foods I Like to Eat</h1>
		<p>I am not a picky person whent it comes to food, but I like eating bread and pastries. One example is <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/rexybitesph">Rexy Bites' cookies and pizza rolls!</a></p>
