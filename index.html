		<h1 class="head"> Hello, World!</h1>

		<br><br><br><br>

		<h1 class="name">What's My Name?</h1>
		<p>Hi! I am Leila Camille L. Cervera.</p>

		<h1 class="nickname">What You Can Call Me</h1>
		<p>People usually call me Leila or Lei :)</p>

		<h1 class="cmsc">Favorite CMSC Subject</h1>
		<p>As of the moment, CMSC 130: Logic Design and Digital Computer Circuits has been my favorite. I really enjoyed studying that subject â€” analyzing the mind-bending problems and answering the challenging exercises. The topics and real-world problems in that subject are really interesting!</p>

		<h1 class="ge">Favorite GE </h1>
		<p>I haven't taken much GE yet, but I enjoyed attending my KAS 1 class. Studying the events that happened in the past (and even the present) in our country became so fascinating. I also enjoyed attending the events with incentives for they are informative too.</p>

		<h1 class="proglang">Favorite Programming Language</h1>
		<p>Because I have no solid programming background, Python has become my favorite language ever since I entered the university. Though it has been quite challenging for me, I guess it's the easiest to understand because it is close to the human language.</p>

		<h1 class="food">Foods I Like to Eat</h1>
		<p>I am not a picky person whent it comes to food, but I like eating bread and pastries. One example is <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/rexybitesph">Rexy Bites' cookies and pizza rolls!</a></p>

		<h1 class="hobbies">Where I Usually Spend My Time On</h1>
                <p>I like to do physical activities like exercising, going out for a walk or a jog, or even cleaning the house (without someone asking me to do it). I also like listening to music and watching series, mostly K-dramas. Exploring arts and crafts is fascinating for me, too. </p>

                <h1 class="dream">What I Wanted To Be When I Grow Up</h1>
                <p>Frankly, until now, I still don't know my answer to that question. It was hard to me to have a concrete dream because growing up, I wanted to try different things but end up not doing it. Profession-wise, I once wanted to be an Interior Designer or a Psychologist. Human-wise, I just wanted to be happy, and be able to help and bring joy to other people.</p>
